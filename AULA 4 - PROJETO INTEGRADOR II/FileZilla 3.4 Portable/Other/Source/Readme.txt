ABOUT FILEZILLA PORTABLE
========================
The FileZilla Portable Launcher allows you to run FileZilla from a removable drive whose
letter changes as you move it to another computer.  The application can be entirely self-
contained on the drive and then used on any Windows computer.


LICENSE

This code is released under the GPL.  The full code is included with this package as
FileZillaPortable.nsi.


INSTALLATION / DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
==================================
By default, the program expects this directory structure:

-\ <--- Directory with FileZillaPortable.exe
	+\App\
		+\filezilla\
	+\Data\
		+\settings\

It can be used in other directory configurations by including the FileZillaPortable.ini
file in the same directory as FileZillaPortable.exe and configuring it as details in the
INI file section below.


FileZillaPortable.INI CONFIGURATION
===================================
The FileZilla Portable Launcher will look for an ini file called FileZillaPortable.ini
within its directory (see the Installation/Directory Structure section above for more
details).  If you are happy with the default options, it is not necessary, though.  The
INI file is formatted as follows:

[FileZillaPortable]
FileZillaDirectory=App\filezilla
SettingsDirectory=Data\settings
FileZillaExecutable=filezilla.exe
AdditionalParameters=
DisableSplashScree=false

The FileZillaDirectory and SettingsDirectory entries should be set to the *relative* path
to the directory containing filezilla.exe and the settings backup.  They must be a
subdirectory (or multiple subdirectories) of the directory containing
FileZillaPortable.exe.  The default entries for these are described in the installation
section above.

The FileZillaExecutable entry allows you to set the FileZilla Portable Launcher to use an
alternate EXE call to launch FileZilla.  This is helpful if you are using a machine that
is set to deny filezilla.exe from running or to launch the writer, calc, etc directly.
You'll need to rename the filezilla.exe file and then enter the name you gave it on the
FileZillaExecutable= line of the INI.

The AdditionalParameters entry allows you to pass additional commandline parameter
entries to filezilla.exe.  Whatever you enter here will be appended to the call to
filezilla.exe.

DisableSplashScreen allows you to disable the splash screen when set to true.


PROGRAM HISTORY / ABOUT THE AUTHOR
==================================
This launcher grew out of my work on the Firefox Portable and Thunderbird Portable
projects.  Some of the ideas arose from discussions relating to Firefox Portable &
Thunderbird Portable in the mozillaZine forums.
